All methods except `get`, `let`, and `set` can be used. This class uses `__callStatic()` method to generate dynamic
types. Each given method will declare the alert type. The most common and recommended method names are `error`, `info`,
and `success`, which can be used to represent [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic)
(`error` as `false`, `info` as `null`, and `success` as `true`).

### Usage

~~~ .php
Alert::error('This is an error message.');
Alert::info('This is an info message.');
Alert::success('This is a success message.');
~~~

It is possible to add parameters to your message like this. All description data will be passed to the `i()` function
internally so they will be easy to translate:

~~~ .php
Alert::error('Please fill out the %s field!', ['name']); // “Please fill out the name field!”
~~~

To display the alert block in your layout, add this line at a specific point in your layout file, for example, under the
form’s opening tag:

~~~ .php
<?= self::alert(); ?>
~~~

The built-in alert block doesn’t care about the type. Every alert created will be passed as a `<p role="alert">…</p>`
element in the HTML output. To generate unique alert block for each type, you need to make your own HTML output in a
`.\lot\y\*\alert.php` file:

~~~ .php
<?php foreach ((array) Alert::get() as $v): ?>
  <p class="alert alert-<?= $v[2]['type']; ?>" role="alert">
    <?= $v[1]; ?>
  </p>
<?php endforeach; ?>
~~~

You can also use hooks to modify the HTML output. However, this hook will have no effect on the alert markup you
manually created in the `.\lot\y\*\alert.php` file (unless you’re following how I form the alert markup in the
`.\x\alert\engine\y\alert.php` file):

~~~ .php
Hook::set('y.alert', function ($y) {
    $y[0] = 'div';
    foreach ($y[1] as &$v) {
        $v[2]['class'] = 'alert';
    }
    $y[2]['class'] = 'alerts';
    return $y;
});
